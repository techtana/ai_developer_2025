        "description": "Box breathing is a simple yet powerful technique for calming the mind and reducing stress. To practice, sit in a comfortable position, inhale deeply through your nose for four counts, hold your breath for four counts, exhale slowly through your mouth for four counts, and hold again for four counts. Repeat this cycle for 5–10 minutes. This structured breathing slows down your nervous system, stabilizes emotions, and helps you regain focus. It’s particularly effective when you feel anxious, overwhelmed, or in need of quick recovery. Regular practice also builds resilience against stress, making it easier to stay calm in difficult situations.",
